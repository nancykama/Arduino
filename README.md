# ArduinoUNO

### Introduction
As part of the electrical module at robotics, I got to experiment with an `ArduinoUno`. There was a series of small projects designed to introduce new `C++` 
functions. 

### What I Learned
I learned a lot of `C++` functions and the basic set up of a project for Arduino. I also learned a lot about ***electrical circuits*** and how energy moves 
throughout the breadboard to power different parts like the potentiometer, or the piezo, or the LEDs. I also learned about ***analyzing signal waves*** sent from 
the `ArduinoUNO` because after each project produced our desirable outcome, we connnected the Arduino to an ***ossiliscope*** and utilized the different settings to 
gain a clearer understanding of how the ***voltage*** is moving. 

### Takeaways 
I really liked doing the projects because it was rewarding and enlightening to see physical outcomes of our code on the Arduino. I also learned a lot about both
***software and hardware*** through ***electrical*** and it was a captivating module to do. I definitely recommend using the `ArduinoUNO` because it provides a great way to 
introduce yourself to `C++` and the projects can be applied to other ideas you may have since most of the projects are base level and can be enhanced and applied to 
a variety of different settings.
